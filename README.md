NymLabs is a web-app that aims to boost the emergence of new space technology ventures from promoting collaborative work and visibility of space projects in addition to the access to local and international resources and services. 
Any person or organization interested in developing, collaborating, or enrolling in a project could create an account and either add a new project or request to work on another project. All the projects will be visible and categorized in web-app. The users could follow all the projects or tags of their interest. Project leaders looking to onboard new people could access selected user profiles that fit the project requirements.  Project members will have access to a service catalog, where they can find local services, large-scale services, and support content. Local businesses could display their services through catalog services. Large services and resources, such as NASA Open Data Sets or AWS Cloud Platforms, will also show up in the Service Catalog.

## Description of the problem

Great advances in space technology are often connected to later improvements in other sectors of the economy. Small and medium-sized startups play a fundamental role in the transfer of all these technologies to the economic branches of daily life. However, in Latin America, the absence of space agencies in most countries added to the lack of integration of project’s databases translates into a weak rate of new startups. This can be reflected in the low number of organizations in Latin America which are members of the IAF, having just 21 active members in one of the most important space networks in the world.

According to Greg Bahlmann from Tribe Mine Blog there are six important online networking platforms or “B2B Social networks”, these have the following tools: 

- Messaging 
- Engagement 
- Mobile App
- Profile Building
- Connection Ranking
- Reconnection Reminders
- Community Support
- Off site Profile Building
- Advertising
- Free Tier
- Memberships

We noticed that no network has tools to engage with projects instead just with companies of individuals, also we realized that these tools do not have resources to improve the development of the projects after the connection.


## SOLUTION

The platform is intended to be used by independent researchers, research groups, startups, companies, educational institutions, professionals, environmental protection agencies, and many others. People would start by creating a personal account, in which person account users can create and manage organization and project accounts, generate participation requests, track projects of interest, and access a personalized service catalog. As a result of these facilities, collaborative work within the projects and their visibility will be promoted, as well as the strengthening of existing companies that provide services and products.

PANTALLAZOS DE APLICACIÓN (INICIO DE SESIÓN, PERFILES, SERVICIOS)

The web-app is divided into 4 sections, Projects, Feed, Services Catalog and My account. Each one of these sections are described in detail below.

### Projects

Every project created in the platform counts with a defined structure. This structure is composed by:

- Title
- Brief description
- Type of Project (Academic, Startup, Business)
- Responsable(s)
- Indicate if it is looking to onboard new people
- If they are looking for members, indicate type of enrollment (paid or voluntary)
- Tags

In order to specify the type of project, if they are looking to onboard new people and if the kind of enrollment, we use the following 5 symbols. 

IMAGEN CON LOS SÍMBOLOS, INDICANDO QUÉ SIGNIFICA CADA UNO

The users could filter their searches by those 5 symbols. We also use a tag system to make filtering by topics. These tags are provided by the creator of the project profile.

PANTALLAZO CON PANTALLA DE FILTRO DE PROYECTOS

This section shows a list with all the projects and their basic information in a card format. By clicking on the project of interest, all the data shown above is displayed. Additionally, the user could start following any project of their interest just by clicking on the follow button.

### Feed

Keeping track of projects, organizations, and topics of interest is a necessary tool to achieve continuous new collaborations and the emergence of new projects. This section has two ways to keep the user informed about updates and new releases. One way, called "Following", shows updates related to the projects and the organization that the user follows, while the other view, called "General feed", shows the projects and organizations recommended to users based on their interests, along with relevant data about international organizations such as space agencies and programs.

#### Following

As mentioned earlier this subsection shows the projects the user is subscribed to. It shows the activities and updates made by the other members of the projects. The way in which this activity is displayed is through a list of projects where the order is defined by the project activity and the interest shown by the user in each project. In this way, users can continue to review projects that interest them more quickly.

PANTALLAZO SECCIÓN FOLLOWING


#### General Feed

All projects with tags similar to the projects you follow, each new project from an organization you already follow, and the latest releases from space agencies and programs related to your interest will be displayed here. This will allow the user to explore new projects and news in a more efficient and personalized way.
