### Project Title

NymLabs - Space Development Everywhere

### Provide a high-level summary of your project 700 (9 lineas)

Great advances in space technology are often connected to later improvements in other sectors of the economy. Small and medium-sized startups play a fundamental role in the transfer of all these technologies to the economic branches of daily life. However, in Latin America, the absence of space agencies in most countries added to the lack of integration of project’s databases translates into a weak rate of emergence of new ventures.

NymLabs finds collaborative work and visibility as boosters of new developments. Consequently, it is proposed a “Social network for projects” that allows to show and interact with other developments, while offering useful tools for the growth of projects.


### Describe how your project addresses this challenge 

We developed an application to promote the collaboration and the access to resources in space projects. 

The proposed application is important because in our experience related to space project development, in our country specifically, we have seen a lot of work being done by different kinds of institutions, this work is actually shared and published, however, these efforts are still found scattered in various sources and databases making it hard to pull everything together and get more productive and helpful efforts, in that order of ideas, the need to have an unified platform to create, manage and share projects for space industry is the problematic we decided to work on. 

With this development we hope to give a helpful tool to show effectively space related work and make enrolling more people into them or join similar efforts easier to make more impactful and coordinated innovations and discoveries. 

What did you develop? Why is it important? What does it do? How does it work? What do you hope to achieve?

### Describe how you developed your project

We chose this challenge because it was the most related to our objective, 
What inspired your team to choose this challenge? What was your approach to developing this project? What tools, coding languages, hardware, software did you use to develop your project? What problems and achievements did your team have?

#### How did you use space agency data in your project?

When we studied the possibilities of improvement based on the different categories of SpaceApps Challenge we decided one of the best things we could do was to centralize and engage all those resources and make them more accessible to developers at a wide range of levels. 

We are aiming our work to have that available data as one of the app engines, since our idea is based on joining all efforts as much as possible, we plan to have a catalog of useful resources the user would need to have a successful result. Having in mind that space is the central axis of the projects posted in the platform the data from space agencies will be the most important people will have access to. . 

You can use any open data you'd like. However, to be eligible for Judging, you must also use data from NASA and/or one of NASA's partner agencies for Space Apps 2020 (CSA, CNES, JAXA, etc.). Describe how it was used or how it influenced your project.

#### Demonstrate your solution
Provide a "demo" of your project by sharing a public link to slides (up to 7) or a video (30 second limit). Please note: all links must be public and working properly (they should not require permission or registration to access them.)

### Share your code (if applicable)

### CHALLENGE 
#### CONNECT:
Connection empowers us to take action together. Challenges in this category will ask you to examine methods for communicating with one another, and to analyze the complex networks of people and ideas that contribute to space agency missions on Earth and in space.

#### Space Exploration in Your Backyard:

The work of space exploration (and the societal benefits it brings) permeates every location and facet of society. Your challenge is to create a visual representation of the breadth of the space sector’s influence, showing the network of organizations an
